Sitecore Language Registration PowerTool - 

This tool adds custom Cultures to .Net. The purpose of this is so that Sitecore can add and utilize custom languages.

It uses a simple CSV File as input for the Language Registration and registers the new Cultures utilizing the .Net System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder classes.

It also produces a Sitecore Powershell script based on the data configured in the CSV file that adds the custom Language to Sitecore - in sitecore/system/languages.
